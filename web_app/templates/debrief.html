    <h3>Debrief</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of our study was to investigate the persuasive potential of a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) system called large language models (LLM). An LLM is an advanced AI system designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It's a type of machine learning model, which means it learns by analyzing vast amounts of text data and identifying patterns, structures, and relationships within the text.</p>
    <p>When you interact with an LLM, you provide it with a prompt or a question, and it generates a relevant response based on the patterns and knowledge it has learned during its training. An LLM is still a machine learning system, and its knowledge is limited to the data it was trained on. It might not always provide the most accurate or up-to-date information, and it can sometimes generate responses that don't make perfect sense. However, as AI technology advances, these models continue to improve in their understanding and generation of human language.</p>
    <p>Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) have developed the ability to generate persuasive political messages, raising concerns about their potential to influence political outcomes by supercharging microtargeting. By incorporating the data you entered earlier in the experiment, the LLM used in our experiment was able to generate messages specifically designed to appeal to you, thus increasing the likelihood of persuasion. We displayed these micro-targeted messages to you and other participants to observe how you may react to them and whether they could change your mind on various topics.</p>
    <p>To reiterate, in this experiment, the messages that you were exposed to were written by AI (in the form of an LLM). Furthermore, the messages were tailored, or “micro-targeted” to be persuasive to someone of your particular demographic and political profile.</p>
    <p>We hope that our research can contribute to a better understanding of how to make these models safer and reduce the risk of their misuse in nefarious political operations. We appreciate the time you spent participating in this experiment.
